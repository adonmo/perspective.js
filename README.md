**perspective.ts** is a TypeScript library which allow you to transform a rectangle image into an arbitrary form of quadrilateral on a canvas element. It is used to draw an image using perspective on a canvas.

**perspective.ts** is a fork of [**perspective.js**](https://github.com/wanadev/perspective.js), which is itself a derivative work of the original [Futomi Hatano's **perspective.js**](http://www.html5.jp/test/perspective_canvas/demo1_en.html)
